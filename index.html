      <!-- I used ChatGPT for the prompt: for the earth and moon page I'd like you to take on the role of an 18th century astronomer giving a brief description of the celestial body and the Earth-Moon navigation-->
      <p>
        Behold the Earth, a wandering sphere suspended in the vast Æther, adorned with seas, continents,
        and an atmosphere most singular among the heavenly bodies. 
        From its surface we observe the orderly motions of the cosmos, 
        measuring time by the Sun and charting the firmament by night. 
        Attend also to her faithful companion, the Moon, whose presence governs the tides and offers a nearby world for contemplation;
        by selecting it, the observer may turn his study outward from Earth unto her celestial attendant.
