      <h1>Moon</h1>
      <p>
        Here we regard the Moon, Earth’s constant satellite, whose pale countenance waxes and wanes
        with dependable regularity. Though barren and devoid of air, she serves as a most useful instrument
        to the astronomer, revealing the mechanics of motion, shadow, and gravitation. 
        By returning one’s attention to the Earth, the observer may resume his station upon the inhabited globe 
        from which these nightly observations first commence.
